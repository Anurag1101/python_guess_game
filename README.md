### Navigate to the directory:

    cd python_guess_game

### Ensure you have `Python 3.x` installed.

## Usage:

1. Run the game with the following command: python guess_game.py

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game. Youâ€™ll see your score, and if it's higher than the high score, it will be saved as the new high score.


How It Works
Generating a Random Score: The play_game() function generates a score between 1 and 1000 using Python's random module.
Retrieving High Score: The get_high_score() function reads the high score from main.txt if it exists. If the file is missing or contains invalid data, the high score defaults to 0.
Saving High Score: When a new high score is achieved, the save_high_score() function updates main.txt with the new score.
Game Loop: The main() function allows players to replay the game, asking them if they want to play another round or exit.
Future Improvements
Custom Scoring Range: Allow players to set their preferred range for random scores.
Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to display multiple high scores.
User Profiles: Allow different users to maintain separate high scores.
Enjoy playing the Python Guess Game and see if you can beat the high score!
